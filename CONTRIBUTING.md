# Contributing

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Omnifocus Scripts repository.

Every script lives in their own directory and includes a permissive free software license. Both the compiled and uncompiled script are present.

### Sample directory
Name of Script/  
└─ Name of Script.applescript (Source)  
└─ Name of Script.scpt (Compiled)  
└─ README.md (Instructions)  
└─ Resources/  
│ └─ Name of Script-icon.png (Icon)  
└─ LICENCE (Permissive licence)  

## Keep it fresh!

Every script is expected to be working with the latest version of OmniFocus without any dependencies.

Scripts that do not work as expected (as of old age) are depreciated and moved to the retired branch.
From there, scripts can be revived.

Thanks!
