# OmniFocus-OmniOutliner Export

**by Curt Clifton**

The scripts here allow you to create OmniOutliner outlines:

-   from your complete projects list in OmniFocus,
-   from your current (filtered) view, or
-   from the currently selected projects.


## Installation

1. Copy the scripts into the folder [create the folder if necessary]:

    `~/Library/Scripts/Applications/OmniFocus`

2. Add the Scripts menu to your menu bar if you haven't already by
opening the AppleScript Utility, located in `/Applications/AppleScript/`, and selecting the “Show Script Menu in menu bar” checkbox. The menu
should appear on the right side of the menu bar.

3. If you like, use Customize Toolbar in OmniFocus to add some or all of
the new scripts to your toolbar.

## Versions

-   0.1.3, updated for OmniFocus AppleScript implementation change
-   0.1.2, bug fix for change in OmniFocus scripting dictionary
-   0.1.1, bug fix for change in OmniFocus scripting dictionary
-   0.1, initial release

## Disclaimers

OmniFocus is still in alpha testing, so the scripts may break at any
time. I suspect that I'll continue to use and maintain them until the Omni Group provides built-in support, so I'm likely to maintain the scripts for awhile at least.
